## Status

Superceded by [2. Discarded after no native Windows support](0002-discarded-after-no-native-windows-support.md)

Further considerations to run ADR on Windows environments [3. For Windows 10 systems use it from Ubuntu:bash or VM](0003-for-windows-10-systems-use-it-from-ubuntu-bash-or-vm.md)

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
